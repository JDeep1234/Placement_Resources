# 1. What is Network

A computer network is a system that connects many independent computers to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily. A computer network is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together. A network connection can be established using either cable or wireless media. Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.

## Functionalities of Computer Network

- Computer Networks help in operating virtually
- Computer Networks integrate on a large scale
- Computer Networks respond very quickly in case of conditions change
- Computer Networks help in providing data security

## Key Components of a Computer Network

In simple terms, a computer network is made up of two main parts: devices (called nodes) and connections (called links). The links connect the devices to each other. The rules for how these connections send information are called communication protocols. The starting and ending points of these communications are often called ports.The key components are :
- Network Devices
- Links
- Communication Protocols
- Network Defense

## How Does a Computer Network Work?
Computer Networks simply work using nodes and links. Data communication equipment is simply termed as Nodes. For example, Modems, Hubs, Switches, etc. whereas links in Computer networks can be referred to as a connection between two nodes. We have several types of links like cable wires, optical fibers, etc. 

Whenever a Computer Network is working, nodes have the work of sending and receiving data via the links. Computer Network provides some set of protocols that help in following the rules and protocols.

## Criteria of a Good Network
- Performance: It can be measured in many ways, including transmit time and response time. Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another. Response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response. The performance of the network depends on a number of factors, including the number of users, the type of medium & Hardware.
- Reliability: In addition to accuracy is measured by frequency of failure, the time it takes a link to recover from failure, and the network’s robustness in catastrophe. 
- Security: Network security issues include protecting data from unauthorized access, protecting data from damage and development, and implementing policies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data loss.  

# 2. Types of Network 

## Division Based on Area Covered
- Local Area Network (LAN): A LAN is a network that covers an area of around 10 kilometers. For example, a college network or an office network. Depending upon the needs of the organization, a LAN can be a single office, building, or Campus. We can have two PCs and one printer in-home office or it can extend throughout the company and include audio and video devices. Each host in LAN has an identifier, an address that defines hosts in LAN. A packet sent by the host to another host carries both the source host’s and the destination host’s address.
- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): MAN refers to a network that covers an entire city. For example: consider the cable television network.
- Wide Area Network (WAN): WAN refers to a network that connects countries or continents. For example, the Internet allows users to access a distributed system called www from anywhere around the globe.WAN interconnects connecting devices such as switches, routers, or modems. A LAN is normally privately owned by an organization that uses it. We see two distinct examples of WANs today: point-to-point WANs and Switched WANs 
   - Point To Point: Connects two connecting devices through transmission media. 
   - Switched: A switched WAN is a network with more than two ends.

## Types of Computer Network Architecture
Computer Network Architecture is of two types. These types are mentioned below.

- Client-Server Architecture: Client-Server Architecture is basically the architecture where the clients and the server are connected as two clients can communicate with each other and the devices present work as servers in the network.
- Peer-to-Peer Architecture: Peer-to-Peer Architecture, computers are connected to each other and each computer is equally capable of working as there is no central server here. Each device present here can be used as a client or server.
