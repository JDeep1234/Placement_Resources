# 1. What is Network

A computer network is a system that connects many independent computers to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily. A computer network is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together. A network connection can be established using either cable or wireless media. Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.

## Functionalities of Computer Network

- Computer Networks help in operating virtually
- Computer Networks integrate on a large scale
- Computer Networks respond very quickly in case of conditions change
- Computer Networks help in providing data security

## Key Components of a Computer Network

In simple terms, a computer network is made up of two main parts: devices (called nodes) and connections (called links). The links connect the devices to each other. The rules for how these connections send information are called communication protocols. The starting and ending points of these communications are often called ports.The key components are :
- Network Devices
- Links
- Communication Protocols
- Network Defense
