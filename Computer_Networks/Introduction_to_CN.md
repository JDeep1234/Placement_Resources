# 1. What is Network

A computer network is a system that connects many independent computers to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily. A computer network is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together. A network connection can be established using either cable or wireless media. Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.

## Functionalities of Computer Network

- Computer Networks help in operating virtually
- Computer Networks integrate on a large scale
- Computer Networks respond very quickly in case of conditions change
- Computer Networks help in providing data security

## Key Components of a Computer Network

In simple terms, a computer network is made up of two main parts: devices (called nodes) and connections (called links). The links connect the devices to each other. The rules for how these connections send information are called communication protocols. The starting and ending points of these communications are often called ports.The key components are :
- Network Devices
- Links
- Communication Protocols
- Network Defense

## How Does a Computer Network Work?
Computer Networks simply work using nodes and links. Data communication equipment is simply termed as Nodes. For example, Modems, Hubs, Switches, etc. whereas links in Computer networks can be referred to as a connection between two nodes. We have several types of links like cable wires, optical fibers, etc. 

Whenever a Computer Network is working, nodes have the work of sending and receiving data via the links. Computer Network provides some set of protocols that help in following the rules and protocols.

## Criteria of a Good Network
-Performance: It can be measured in many ways, including transmit time and response time. Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another. Response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response. The performance of the network depends on a number of factors, including the number of users, the type of medium & Hardware.
-Reliability: In addition to accuracy is measured by frequency of failure, the time it takes a link to recover from failure, and the networkâ€™s robustness in catastrophe. 
-Security: Network security issues include protecting data from unauthorized access, protecting data from damage and development, and implementing policies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data loss.
